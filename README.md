Enhancing Credit Risk Evaluation in
Automotive Finance: A Machine Learning
Approach

Credit risk assessment is important for auto finance companies to reduce financial losses,
defaults, and repossessions while promoting market stability. Traditional credit scoring models that
rely on limited data have struggled to accurately predict the probability of default. This capstone
project explores and focuses on the use of advanced machine learning techniques to improve credit
risk assessment by leveraging large datasets and algorithmic complexity. This capstone project
focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict consumer default in the automotive
finance industry using Volvo Financial Services credit data. The project aims to identify important
determinants of credit risk and evaluate how machine learning systems work well to predict the
probability of defaults. The study begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, which
includes various financial indicators such as net worth, working capital, and revenue. This analysis
helps in understanding the distribution of the target variable and identifying outliers that could
affect the risk assessment mode This analysis helps in understanding the distribution of the target
variable and identifying outliers that could affect the risk assessment model. The project follows a
methodological approach that includes data preprocessing to address missing values and outliers
and feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of financial key indicators in credit risk.
The research work aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk assessment by
adopting machine learning models that can incorporate real-time data and capture non-linear
relationships. This would help automotive finance companies predict and manage credit risk more
effectively, thereby drastically reducing defaults and repossessions. Overall, this abstract highlights
the process and expected outcomes of the study, with emphasis on the potential of machine learning
to transform risk assessment practices in automotive finance.
